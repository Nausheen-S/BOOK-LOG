# BOOK-LOG


1.	PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Avid readers need a way to see the books available, and the books they’ve read so far, so as to be able to keep track of books they’ve read and also want to re-read.


2.	SOLUTION STATEMENT:

I believe that, I can help them by providing them with an application with which they can maintain a reading list and also keep track of the books they have completed so far.
